Topic: Machine Learning to detect emotions on faces.

Reasoning:
    Checking live emotions at a live performance - real-time customer satisfaction
    Market research - focus groups reactions
    Political debate/townhall audience reaction

How much data: 35888 faces

What was used to train? Model size and architecture, resnet?
CNN network
    Build layers of Convolution and Pooling. 
    Example of the project used dropout layers to prevent overfitting by dropping half of the neurons temporarily.
    Finish with Dense layers to predict the output.

System info from example project: Took around 1 hour for with an Intel Core i7-7700K 4.20GHz processor and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB gpu
