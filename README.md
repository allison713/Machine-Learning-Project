### Project Description

In this project, we will be analyzing human emotions at a live performance:
* Live performance
* Sports Event
* Political Debate

## Data:
Grayscale portraits of faces measuring 48 Ã— 48 pixels make up the data. The faces have been automatically registered so that each face roughly fills the same amount of space in each image and is roughly centered. The aim is to classify each face into one of seven categories based on the emotion displayed in the facial expression (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).

"Emotion" and "Pixels" are two columns in train.csv. The emotion that is present in the image is represented by a numeric code in the "emotion" column that ranges from 0 to 6, inclusive. For each image, a string enclosed in quotes is present in the "pixels" column. The values in this string are separated by spaces and are arranged in row major order. The "pixels" column is the only one in test.csv.

## Process:
The data was downloaded as a CSV file using the python library pandas. Then using matplotlib and numpy we visualized the model. We did not use spark as we are going to convert everything back to pandas liberaries. We used AWS S3 bucket to store our file and as a repository for google colab and we also used Keras to build convolution model so we can expresses the amount of overlap of one function as it is shifted over another function.
